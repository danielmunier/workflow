## Overview

This project employs the Kanban style to organize and visualize tasks and activities. It was created to help me organize my daily tasks, as I often found myself trying to do too many things at once and forgetting what I was working on.

## 🌟How Kanban Helps
- Visualization: Tasks are represented as cards on a Kanban board with columns like "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done". This gives a clear visual representation of the work and its status.
- Focus on Flow: Kanban emphasizes a smooth and continuous flow of tasks from start to finish. You can identify bottlenecks more easily and make adjustments to improve the efficiency of the workflow.
